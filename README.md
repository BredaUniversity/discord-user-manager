# Discord User Manager

The Discord User Manager allows users to join your Discord server by authenticating with an OAuth2 provider such as Google or Microsoft. This is useful if your school or work is using G Suite for Education from Google or Office 365 and you want to restrict the members of your Discord server to the members of your domain.
